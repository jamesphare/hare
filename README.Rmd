# hare

This package stores my custom themes and functions for personal use. Currently the only function in this package is `theme_james`, a slightly more minimal version of `theme_minimal`.

## Installation

You can install `hare` like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jamesphare/hare")
```

## Usage

Load the library:

``` r
library(hare)
```

`theme_james()` may be added to a GGPlot object or set generally using `theme_set()`.

## Example

```{r}
theme_set(theme_james)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Title",
       subtitle = "Subtitle",
       caption = "Source: GGPlot2")
```
